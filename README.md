Our version Gomoku is a game played by two people on a tic-tac-toe type of board
Instead of 3x3, it is 20x20. Each player puts a peice down, altenating with each
turn until one person makes it to 5 in a row.

Currently, Minimax with alpha beta pruning is being used
Eventually we want to impiment Monte Carlo Tree Searches with neual networks
