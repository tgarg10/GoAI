# Go AI

Gomoku is a game played by two people on a tic-tac-toe type of board. Instead of 3x3, our game was 20x20. Each player puts a peice down, altenating with each turn until one person makes it to 5 in a row.
There are two kinds of games: the Short Game (that ends after one player wins) and the Long Game that goes on until the board fills out.

Currently, Minimax with alpha beta pruning is being used
Eventually we want to impiment Monte Carlo Tree Searches with neual networks 

To run the file: run GraderGUI.java which runs all the files ending with FP.java in the folder. 
To play against specific FP.java yourself, use TicTacToeGUI.java
